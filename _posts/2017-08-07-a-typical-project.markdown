I've learned a huge amount about leadership and project, release, and
development management over the last few years at the Ministry of
Justice.

I'm going to start by listing my axioms for a sucessful project.
Foremost, the objective is to get them written down.  I will expand on
those that require such in future posts.

So, to start:

## Project Management

* Have an estimated, prioritised backlog.  Know where it is and include
everything.  All the swim lanes in the world won't help you if you can't
see your backlog for the next few sprints.

* Ensure the esitmation process is lightweight and open to everyone in
the team.  Let team members opt themselves out of specific estimations
if the ticket doesn't apply to them.

* Keep sprints short.

* Keep planning session short and do them often.

* Use an online tool to ask for ad hoc estimations.

* Use epics sparingly.

* Use tags extensively.

* Agree a vocabulary.

## Repositories

* Use the simplest possible merge or rebase workflow and the fewest
number of branches you can get away with.

* [Write meaningful commit messages](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md). It's not poetry, it's technical writing.

## Development

* Do the simplest possible thing that will close the ticket.

* Start with a test.

* Pay off the technical debt as soon as you find it.
